# Design-System

Where styling your website becomes manageable.

## Brief

The Design System is influenced by major UI design concepts: Style Guide and UI Component Library.

The notion of 'tokens' simplify any complex computer or cultural values into a sequence of numbers.

Derived from a premade Style Guide, The main category that will be covered in this Design System are:

* Typography

* Space

* Grid System

* Color

Other repos in considerations includes:

* CSS resets

These may or may not have sub categories, such as, 'breakpoints' for Responsive Design (new layout). It will might include a new set of Design systems. However, I will tailor it to basic functions and it will be up to the user to do interesting feats.

## To-Do List

- Create repo: CSS and older browser supports

- Create repo: CSS w/ variables

- SASS

- CSS w/ frameworks
